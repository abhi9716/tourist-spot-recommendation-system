place,reviews
Lal Tibba,The best time to visit this attraction is early morning around 7 am before the tourists start arriving and destroy the peace and tranquility. In recent years lot of illegal construction has taken place in the area which spoil the natural beauty of the place. The valley view is…
Lal Tibba,"Disappointing, considering the hype around it. Clogged traffic and when u finally get there its just a hill top with view across. Wasn’t worth the time and energy"
Lal Tibba,Nice location since it was clear sky we could enjoy Himalayan views There is a photographer there who takes money and tell he will deliver photos at hotel. He never come and absolute cheat Beware
Lal Tibba,Owasm place during the ⛅ sunrise & sunset. A coffee shop is available. The masala tea is very good. It's highest pick of moossurie. The view of Himalayas is owsam.
Lal Tibba,Its just a 2 Story structure with a old age binocular.....which is so dull that u cant see anything.... 50/- per person charge.... Most useless spot ever been to....
Lal Tibba,"We went here for breakfast. However, the weather was bad on the day and hence clouds spoiled our party. However, the vibe and the limited views were amazing. There's a rooftop cafe which serves snacks and hot beverages. Do try that at a minimal cost. Please note that the road to…"
Lal Tibba,"I went there in 1993 and it was too good to visit as there was no commercialization and crowd there, But this time I went by my own car and it was hell to go there by own vehicle. Just 1 vehicle can pass and due to this you may face jams ranging from few minutes to hours.…"
Lal Tibba,"Since my last visit, Lal Tibba continues to be a must visit place for me. I would recommend walking though the road is well maintained to take your car. Once you reach the peak, it gives an amazing view of the Himalayas. not much in terms of eateries but you wil surely get…"
Lal Tibba,If the weather is clear....the view is truly breathtaking. The cafe provides lovely coffee by Rohit....was a pleasure the coffee after viewing the sunrise at 07:00am
Lal Tibba,Lal tibba is around 20 mins drive from mall road. Rs.1050 by cab return fare. There are two restaurants there with binoculars on their terraces. The view is nothing great. It was a little cloudy when we were there. In fact the valley views from the mall road are better. The only…
Lal Tibba,"Good area, was clean, saw many Himalayan peaks.. it was cold very cold up there as it was pretty high.. overall a good experience"
Lal Tibba,A peaceful and secluded place with great view of Himalayan snow peaks and some great food options. Approach road to Lal Tibba through winding raods of Landour is also a treat
Lal Tibba,"I rented a Scooty for the day and the ride upto Lal Tibba was heavenly. Winding, snow covered roads and slopes add to the serenity of the whole experience. A must visit!"
Lal Tibba,"During our walk we came across this little place, they had really nice Ginger Lemon tea.a few snacks"
Lal Tibba,"We went to lal tibba just at sunset.. It was freezing as this is highest point in mussoorie. The view, food was truely worth the visit."
Lal Tibba,First of all...Lal Tibba is not a place worth visiting You go all hyped and pumped...just to see a mediocre place of a little scenic beauty. Naah...
Lal Tibba,"Just stroll beyond the legendary Char Dukaan in Landour and you will reach Lal Tibba in about 5 -7 minutes. Situated between three levels, they serve delectable food and will give you a breathtaking view of the valley. I visited in winters, so were also selling basic winter…"
Lal Tibba,"A great telescopic view ,Poor upkeep! A place with such fabulous and amazing view looks shabby and dirty!although a walk near by is much better and serene"
Lal Tibba,Lal Tibba is basically the highest peak range of Mussorrie Ghats at 8000 feet. Yes when you reach the points you get the most mesmerising views of the mountains. The time when we reached it was the first snow of the season so we had experienced some lovely snow fall wherein we…
Lal Tibba,This is the highest point in Mussoorie and worth visiting. You get a cleat view of 200 degrees of the Himalayas and with a nice coffee shop. On way you can see the landour coffee shops also. Must visit if you are in Mussoorie.
Lal Tibba,Like all other places this place also had become a haven for tourists and hence very crowded. No clear sign posts along the road on how to reach there as well. May be better during off peak seasons
Lal Tibba,We were lucky to have snow fall The place is nice with a good view and has a cafe also to eat. Can go if you have time
Lal Tibba,The drive to Lal Tibba is quite uncomfortable.At the point there is nothing special except a cafe from there are few scenic points. Its quite cold at lal tibba so make sure to pack yourself good.
Lal Tibba,"Truth be told, I was too lazy for a 10km round trip hike and got someone from my hotel to drive me up and back. It’s certainly very scenic up there at the highest point of Mussoorie and worth visiting if you’re in this hill station."
Lal Tibba,Brilliant uphill trek and breathtaking view. Must do road trek in Mussoorie. The trek is insanely beautiful.
Kempty Falls,"Kempty fall's has a sweet charm in itself. A short ride from Walnut Grove, it's got a cable car ride which is fun, specially for little kids. A little dirty down, but cleaning up in progress. Would suggest a visit, and please do not litter. Let's keep our tourist attractions…"
Kempty Falls,Over the years tourists have made this pristine place the worst in Mussoorie. extremely un hygienic you have hundreds of people bathing in the small area and busy clicking selfies. The place is crwded with shops selling cheap stuff and cheap food. It;s quite a nightmarish…
Kempty Falls,"this is a most popular place to visit if you are in Mussoorie, but it is worth visiting only in summers when fall on its full swing, else it is just abnormal photoshop as others."
Kempty Falls,"The place looks fun, but is overcrowded with tourists. The water is clean generally but sometimes when it rains on upper ridges it might be muddy."
Kempty Falls,The place is quiet a tourist spot which is usually very crowded...the water is extreme cold and clear. Totally a fun filled place to visit!
Kempty Falls,If you have 5-6 hours then go for waterfall but I should recommend that old people must avoid this place.
Kempty Falls,"Was an average place, must have been nice decades back. But now seems cluttered and congested with too many constructions around. However the drive to place from mussoorie is a pleasant one but only after u turn from LBSNAA"
Kempty Falls,"The breathtaking views in road, falls are very good, very clean white water fall in small area. Lots of shops available. Only one thing when ropeway is closed its very different to ups & down. Other wise it's owsam"
Kempty Falls,"A very clean waterfall with milky white water. The waterfall has a small area where you can swim, play with water. there are many shops enroute the water fall wherein you can buy souvenirs, toys, clothes, lather products etc. Many small eateries too. It also has a rope way from…"
Kempty Falls,Breath taking view.... One of the best waterfalls which I have seen. Lots of shops and food restaurants outside the falls. Do visit a local souvenir shop run by state tourism board few kms away.... U can have a bath under falls.
Kempty Falls,"Oh my gosh! What a height of the fall! Mind blowing. You will definitely love to touch the chilled water. So breeze and soothing. Also, you enjoy trolly ride here which is now closed in mussoorie.So it will be a awesome experience for your children also."
Kempty Falls,Beautiful fall but too crowded. Many cars made it tough to reach there.. Long jam... Not good for summer. Otherwise is good.
Kempty Falls,"The view is worth walking almost a kilometre down. If you wish to take a plunge in the water, plan it around May-June."
Kempty Falls,This is a small falls with lot of litter. Needs to be preserved better. Public toilets are a problem here.
Kempty Falls,"It was okay. A Bit crowded though. At places there was a lot of litter too. The government and people, if they want, can develop it a lot better"
Kempty Falls,The fall is nice but overhyped. It is really shameful that There is so much trash thrown at the base of the falls.
Kempty Falls,"I visited this place in Feb-2020, may be this is reason that i didnt like this place as there was no such huge falls .. i have visited waterfall in other places and it was nothing compared to those waterfalls ... Also to reach the falls , we had to walk for some 10-15 mins…"
Kempty Falls,It is quite small and not at all maintained. The best part about it was the drive there. If you are there you might want to rent a 2-wheeler and enjoy the ride.
Kempty Falls,"I visited Memory Falls years ago when it was a beautiful natural setting,it has now been totally destroyed by human kind."
Kempty Falls,You will like it only if you like over-touristy places. This is the most famous spot of Mussoorie and hence is visited by loads of people. It also have ropeway to transfer people to the base of the falls and hence ideal for seniors having difficulty to trek till the falls. Also…
Kempty Falls,The waterfall is really nice with good flow of water. You must climb up to see the waterfall from top. There are beautiful places to click yourself and your family. You get maggie and hot tea to enjoy near the fall. The negative part is commercial shops and stalls have…
Kempty Falls,"This place is situated around 17 km from Mussourie, mall road. One can either drive to the place, hire a car or bus as per individual needs. In order to get to the waterfall you need to walk few hundred metres from the parking lot to the place where you can take the cable car.…"
Kempty Falls,Hopeless place Am feeling bad even to give the one dot rating here It’s a dirty place with garbage all over and unnecessary hutments all around the fall Had been here in the past and had felt that this was the best waterfall in India atleast but this visit wiped off all the…
Kempty Falls,"Didn't go down hill, it was quite a top view. Ice heard that there's a nice view from the down hill. However, we were short of time."
Kempty Falls,Its a perineal waterfall and water is there throughout the year. But after travelling for an hour back i would suggest to give it a miss
Company Garden,It is a small but well maintained garden. What spoils the place are the unruly tourists who litter the place and keep taking selfies much to the annoyance of the others. There is a small man made lake with boating facility but the water is too dirty. The few food stalls here are…
Company Garden,We visited the Company Garden. It was probably not the best time of year to visit since not many of the plants were in flower. There are areas for amusement [such as a House of Horrors and a Wax Museum] but these did not appeal to us.
Company Garden,"this is a must visit place if you are with kids, minimum 3 hrs required to visit the place and it is actually worth, be prepared how you will reach there, you can take your car or local Richkshaw (but very expensive) over all it is a good experience."
Company Garden,I went there just out of curiosity to see the place. The garden is well maintained and has other attractions as well besides the flowers and small pond. The parking is small in comparison to the influx of tourists. And the place also is quite small.
Company Garden,"This is big garden with nominal entry fee. It has many small portions of lawn with trees, plants and flower beds. It also has a beautiful waterfall and a lake where you can do paddle boating. Many rides for kids, games, a foot court, many small eateries, a haunted house and some…"
Company Garden,Nothing great to write about.... Its just a normal garden with few 11d and horror house and a dozen of photographers pestering u for pics.... Too far from city....
Company Garden,Well maintained garden. Has a fountain and merry go rounds for children. Tickets only Rs 25 per person. There are shops selling local warm clothes. You may also visit the Wax museum and Food court. Best time to visit in daylight hours from 10 am to 4 pm. There are strong and…
Company Garden,Completely commercialised !!! Constantly have people coming up to you asking you to take a photograph and selling other things. It was a waste of the the Rs 25 entrance charges. We left in 5 minutes.
Company Garden,"Not too worthy to go, but if you have time left in mussoorie you can visit the place with kids. Wax museum is the attraction but there will entry ticket inside the garden again. Boating inside the garden is fun with Infinity view again its chargeable. Food inside the garden is…"
Company Garden,"The company garden is truely nafures paradise, loved the fauna and flora. The boat ride in the garden in winter temperatures was thrilling... The garden js close by to main city and is very much recommended"
Company Garden,"Great location! Serene! But badly kept. I wanted to visit this place and so during my third visit to Mussoorie I managed. But to my dismay, this place is not at all what I thought it will be. The alleys marked for walking are too narrow, restaurants are just a mockery, neither…"
Company Garden,My visit to take the first-hand experience of snow cladded place.Nice place with lot of entertainment for all ages. Wax Musem is high priced.
Company Garden,"A terrible area to park vehicles, an unexciting man made garden, lots of human pests troubling visitors to take couple pictures - in all an embarrassing face of India to the outside world"
Company Garden,Its an ordinary garden with nothing special.Flowers are there but nothing for sale from Nursery.The so called lake for boating ends before starting. Keep your hopes down while visiting
Company Garden,Visited company Garden after seeing 4+ rating from 1000+ reviews but it was not worth at all and it is 4.5 Kms from mall road so ready to pay 500 rs to rickshaw if you can't travel by walk . There was nothing in company garden and you can find better gardens in any other city…
Company Garden,The location is Very good with views but place is not very well maintained even the garden hardly has flowers sitting space and is not well maintained compared to the location . Also the restaurant is excellent with veg food but should have non veg also . Overal nice family…
Company Garden,This place is being ruinned brick by brick as now its being managed by the Govt and its being encroached and badly maintained. what ever is left is worth seeing. Overall the place in being destroyed by local authorities's inefficiency.
Company Garden,"The place is ok, normal gardens, not too much to say. Over hyped, may skip. Car entry is restricted and entry tickets are charged here."
Company Garden,The company garden at Mussorie is a good place maintained well and has many attractions for children and offers opportunities for adults as well for photos at artificial small water fall.
Company Garden,"Garden well looked after... nice place, nothing great Over sold and marketed place again Have children do visit"
Company Garden,Lush green place with glass house. Basically a well maintained garden with eating joints.equipped with lot many activities for children from a pond boat ride to horror house and wax museum and other activities . A beautiful waterfall add to the ambience. Didn't like the wax…
Company Garden,Very nice location . if you are traveling to Mussoorie. You not missed to to visit here. Very good collection of flowers. A small water fall which is very beautiful. Love the place.
Company Garden,The trees are in good health in the garden and it should remain that way .I believe that the authorities should leave it that way and focus on growing and making it more green . The most irritating thing is the loud music blaring from the speakers . That really makes the place…
Company Garden,One should not miss Company Garden while staying in Mussoorie India. The garden has a Long history. It is located on a piece of land by the hill slopes. It’s location for a beautiful garden with some exquisite flowers. A small water flow adds to the beauty. There is a decent…
Company Garden,"Nice fountains,waterfalls & garden, Good food court where you all types of vegetarian cuisines reasonable priced."
Cloud's End,"The road actually ends here and you cannot go any further. It is most probably part of private estate and is partly fenced. But in absence of any guard you can walk around, soaking in the atmosphere. On a windy day it gets quite chilling and it is one of those places that get…"
Cloud's End,"Of all the Mussourie views Clouds End is the most peaceful, romantic and authentic spot. Standing high above eagles flying one can look out at the valleys and mountains for miles and enjoy the forests and clouds that float below. An absolute must for nature lovers."
Cloud's End,"Far away from main Mussorie, this place is a must visit if you want to see the quieter side of Mussorie. Also a good way to spend the entire day. There a lovely meadows where you can relax and enjoy the view from. Since there is steep climb, it is best to know the route well and…"
Cloud's End,The property is in shambles and no one is uplifting it. It was once a high point but now totally in ruins. The ticket is total rip off.
Cloud's End,Worth a visit here. Quite peaceful and scenic. Jwaladevi mandir trek starts here but strangely there arent any sign boards that say so. No instructions or directions.
Cloud's End,Privately manage - ruinned resot - entry fee 200 for 5 minutes worth. Its 100 % owned by some politically influential person.
Cloud's End,"Its a personal estate where one has to pay Rs 150 as entry fee. IN that you get to peek inside a home (which they call museum), a photo gallery and a couple points to click pics. One good thing is that you get to see himalayan ranges on one side and doon valley on the other."
Cloud's End,"I visited the Cloud End and beyond by car along with my wife and two small kids . The area the Kothi of Mr Agarwal which is an English bunglow being maintained and run by his family . I went past by the bunglow , and explore the motorable for another 3 kms .The scenery is…"
Cloud's End,"Private resort ,entry fee 150 per adult. Nothing to see except the resort claims its a museum and we can peek in through glass windows into dusty rooms . Everything is locked and ill maintained. It’s a long drive and really not worth it. A dirty run down canteen serves tea at rs…"
Cloud's End,"Very beautiful place in the modest of nature...grand view,very apt name..clouds end...as if all the clouds are in a hurry to reach here,they'll give you a soft hug and recede...the place is conserved and protected well...some suggestions Canteen could be made better,more…"
Cloud's End,"We went there seeing so many positive reviews but were utterly disappointed , the location is owned by some gentleman and they charge 150 Rs per person entry fee which is not worth it. And by chance if you plant o have something in their cafeteria the prices are exorbiant 175…"
Cloud's End,"The walk up to Cloud's end is good. However, I did not find anything special going inside the estate. It is owned by Dr. Agarwal and they charge INR 200 for adults to enter. Inside you'll find old pics of Mussorrie and one museum is also present. But visitors are only allowed to…"
Cloud's End,Beautiful views await you as you reach the top by car. There is a museum and a gallery of photographs of the British period. Worth going !!
Cloud's End,"This place is at a daunting 45 minutes drive from Library chowk. First things first, even if you are a good driver, totally avoid driving up there. Its crazy. Road is very narrow with space enough only for one vehicle at a time and with the deep valley right on the other side,…"
Cloud's End,Quiet an amazing place with the view and the feel fresh air a windy place. There is the photo gallery which is a must walk through . Great place to have a walk and enjoy the pleasant feels of the mountains and pleasant feels Must visit place ❤️

Cloud's End,"OK Average experience. Good view point with cool mountain air breeze , nice location , good trek with family"
Cloud's End,Far from Delhi and yet close enough to reach in about half a day. The oak trees whisper secrets to you as you walk along the many trails . You will not want to come away.
Cloud's End,Cloud's end seen has good for evening time because lots of people are coming seen sunset and dehradoon light seen at night so it's a good place. Definitely next time am coming with my family and friends..
Cloud's End,This is one of the best places from where you can get such an amazing view of cloud and mountains around the Mussoorie.
Cloud's End,We traveled there last weekend and found the place missed the wow factor. The drive was good with some steep patches. The road is narrow and needs skill if you have to pass another car. The view is great but similar vies are there from almost everywhere in Mussoorie. There is…
Cloud's End,"nice nature! Quite place, monkeys and birds! You can reach this nature reserve walking, car, motobike, bike..."
Cloud's End,"Try Seegreen Cafe for good coffee, hot chocolate and sandwiches. Perfect to sit in the sun and read a book"
Cloud's End,very cool nice place. must spend some time during your morning or evening walk. substantially clean and very green all around.
Cloud's End,The place is very natural and has some good natured view of beautiful landscape. Definitely a place to visit
George Everest's House,The government has finally woken up to the historical value of the house and is getting it restored. Hopefully it will be restored well. As of today it is just a nice pit stop on way to Cloud's end for the magnificent views of the valley this place affords. The house itself has…
George Everest's House,"It's a minimal trek, but is currently being renovated so also need to walk around 3km in a muddy terrain, many eateries are available on the way. You can enjoy the trek as the cold himalayan wind brushes your ears"
George Everest's House,"From the site of the house, the views -- in all directions -- are clear and stunning. A short steep hike up a nearby pinnacle would offer even more, but I did not attempt it in the rain. At the time of my visit in Feb 2020, the entire grounds and the driveway were being…"
George Everest's House,"One of the hidden gems of Uttarakhand is the George Everest Peak or Park Estate built in 1832 and named after Sir George Everest , the surveyor from East India Company. This is located near Mussorie. To be frank enough, when u go towards the place, the roads are completely…"
George Everest's House,Its a basic trek and can de done own your own. We recently visited and the place is under renovation so you have to walk around 2km to reach the place. There are many food joints also.
George Everest's House,"When I was experiencing the nature I relaced a lot . We start from the road ang downwards , this Dow way has well bricked roads. After reaching a little down , take U-turn , there are some small ships over her, and take the path which go upwards, this path is not well…"
George Everest's House,"Under renovation which we didn't know. Horrible & pathetic roads. If you want to go trekking to top of this hill, then it's worth. Otherwise totally waste of time."
George Everest's House,"I visited this site some 4 or more years ago. At that time I was applied at the condition of this rather important fixture in the history of this area. We approached the area via a ‘new road’ and not sure I would have taken any vehicle of mine over it, though my Taxi driver…"
George Everest's House,"This is undoubtedly the best place to visit in Mussoorie. One must not miss it. And I felt that this place must be visited multiple times, at different times of the day,so as to enjoy the different weather view. George Everest House and George Everest Peak is about 300-400 mtr…"
George Everest's House,"George Everest point provides some very nice views. We couldn’t spend much time here because it started raining and got cloudy. There are just 1-2 shops around which serve you tea and maggi.These are a bit overpriced, because it’s difficult to get supplies up here. Also, the…"
George Everest's House,"Beautiful place , you can actually see the clouds below you and coming up, great spot ti be in while in Mussourie"
George Everest's House,MUSSOORIE ia a very beautiful place of uttrakhand which is located in Dehradun distt of uttrakhand indis i have been there many times baya dehradun
George Everest's House,Probably to reach here is a task either walking it up by 2 kms as the roads aren't meant like for driving unless you have Suv. The best time to visit the place would be Early morning so that you get the view of The Himalayan ranges . Which is worth everything to reach this…
George Everest's House,"soothing place to visit...but by walk only as only small car can reach this place, good time is only sun rise...road is very bad !"
George Everest's House,This place has spectacular views. But the the George Everest home can be better restored. It has been completely ruined by the tourist or locals.
George Everest's House,Its ruins now as there seems to be no preservation done. Visit if interested in seeing the house. There is a view of the valley and nothing more beyond.
George Everest's House,The place was very crowded. Lots of veicles and people visiting. Plus the usual wall writings and stuff.
George Everest's House,The house is ruined. The Place has got lot of good views and one can experience peace. The path is not so good and one need to be careful while driving up to this place
George Everest's House,"The walk up is not great, I'll admit. The view from the hill on which the house is situated is spectacular, especially when the sun is setting. However, when you get there, you will have one of two reactions: 1. ""People have destroyed it with their useless and absurd graffiti.""…"
George Everest's House,"One of the best places we happen to visit in Mussoorie was George Everest House, though post monsoon the last 02 kms are treacherous with broken road. It requires a real skilled driver to negotiate it especially when returning to your base in Mussoorie. Hire a sedan with a…"
George Everest's House,"Nice scenes from the house. There is also a small hike one can do to a nearby hill-top which can take 30 - 45 minutes to climb and give really amazing views all around. There are small shops that server Paranthas, Noodles etc as refreshment. The road to this place is quite bad…"
George Everest's House,First you have walk Through a path for approx. 15-20 mins. here you will find some landscape where George Everest house was built. [ Not maintained at all by government] you can climb the mountain there slightly steep.
George Everest's House,I visited George Everest mussoorie on Sept month. It is a nice place to visit. There is an old house which was once upon a time occupied by George Everest. It is in a dilapidated condition. There is scenic bueaty but the road was horrible. It was taking also so one should not…
George Everest's House,This is a place to visit if you like serene places. The view from this place is also excellent. Worth a visit.
George Everest's House,This is an offbeat place so when in mussorie travellers you must visit this place without thinking for a second . This place is so peaceful you will listen the birds . The place offers the best view of dehradun and himalayas . The dog would accompany you to the place and wont…
SOHAM Heritage & Art Centre,"First thing first, please don't go by the name 'Heritage & Art Centre'. This place is more than just being an Art centre.

SOHAM Heritage & Art Centre,Nothing spectacular about this place. One thing a person misses in Mussoorie and anywhere in UK state is authentic food and stuffs availability.
SOHAM Heritage & Art Centre,I visited SOHAM Heritage Centre and was fascinated by the aspects of our rich Indian culture. It was educational and inspirational for me and my kid likewise. Loved the hospitality and the new things I learnt about our Pahari culture.
SOHAM Heritage & Art Centre,"The centre is located on a steep downslope (100 mtr) that may be slippery when raining, so go prepared. The ascent from road to the actual galleries is via steps that could be telling on the knees for some. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the tour is informative and…"

Gun Hill,You can go to top of the hill either by road which is stiff and narrow or by rope way which is chargeable Rs.75/- p.p.So almost all prefer to go by rope way thus increasing the waiting time at rope way to almost an hour during season time. But what you see once you go to top by…
Gun Hill,The long queue of tourists wanting to go up the rope way is no indication of the place. Other than a quick ride on the ropeway there is no other plus with this attraction. The top is terrible with unhygienic food stalls and vendors selling cheap Chinese stuff. The views are not…
Gun Hill,This place called Gun Hill is a cable car ride from the mall road. It's a small 5 minute ride but we walked up. The walk is steep but when you reach the top the view of the snow capped mountains from the back is really good.

Gun Hill,"I chose to walk up instead of using the trolley. So I can honestly say that it’s a good physical challenge, but you get great views along the way. Up at the top it’s like a fairground attraction. It’s low season and some of the attractions were shut. Most of those were for…"

Gun Hill,Very disappointed. Ride up the cable car and arrive at a sprawling concreted area surrounded by stalls mostly selling tat. Some decent views here and there if you tried hard to find them.
Gun Hill,Gun Hill is the second highest point in Mussoorie and is located about 400 feet above the Mall. You can access it by ropeway or take the half hour long trek from court complex on Mall road. We took the easy way- the ropeway. Once there we didn't find much to do around so we sat…

Gun Hill,Gun Hill (Top Tibba) and Lal Tibba (Red Hill) are two view points (look outs) not to be missed while in Mussoorie India. You can take an inexpensive cable car to the TOP of Gun Hill. There used to be a Cannon (Gun) during British Raj at the TOP. Views from the TOP are just…
Gun Hill,"Aside from a specific view ON a clear day, not sure what other reason there might be to take the Cable box up or the walking route. The top is a mass of shop,shops, shops. The location no doubt has an appeal for being the high point of Mussooire but then Sisters Bazzar and…"

Ram Jhula,"Quite busy from 9 am to 10 pm with motorcycles, cows, bicycles, carts, and people. Lit up and beautiful at night. A nice place to listen to the daily puji ceremony."
Ram Jhula,Great way to pay obeisance to d river by going across walking n enjoying d breathtaking scenery Took a guide to explain d place
Ram Jhula,The bridge was truly remarkable. Beautiful scenery. The only flip side was the motor bikes which was allowed on the bridge. They had no patience for the pedestrians.
Ram Jhula,It is an impressive bridge across River Ganga. You can get good views if you visited it during the day time. Unfortunately we visited it at night. Still the views of the night lights of the city around amazed us. The Rishikesh Ganga arati which happens nearby is a must watch if…
Ram Jhula,The view is just amazing and worth a visit. I visited the place late in the night and was not disappointed with the place at all.
Ram Jhula,"The Ram Jhula is one of 2 major suspension bridges over the River Ganges in Rishikesh. Like the Lakshman Jhula, it’s also supposed to be a pedestrian only bridge in theory, but plenty of motorcycles use the bridge anyway. This bridge is far more impressive than the Lakshman…"

Ram Jhula,The bridge itself is quite nice looking. Unfortunately all motorcycles constantly honking and trying to pass all the people ruin the atmosphere. I prefered the other bridge way more where the motorcycles are not allowed.
Ram Jhula,A Suspension bridge over the Holi river Ganga connecting the two sides. There is boat facilities as well to cross the river
Ram Jhula,Very crowded and I'll recommend that motorcycles to be avoided. You do get a beautiful view of the ganges. One of the attraction of Rishikesh.
Ram Jhula,It is made in the memory of Swami Shivananda in 1986 on his birth Centenary. Initially and officially the bridge name was Shivananda Bridge but people never called it by that name due to sentimental reasons of Luxman Jhula Bridge ( Luxman ji is was Younger Brother of Shri Ram -…

Patna Waterfalls,"This is quite a walk on foot from Rishikesh, but worth a visit as it’s beautiful- so far removed from the dusty road below and all the noise of the town... There aren’t any signposts so you’ll need to ask people along the way as google maps only points you in the general right…"

Patna Waterfalls,A very brief trek. Go here with a very good friend or a lover. A group of 3 to 4 good friends is ideal. Don't loose way as this falls in the midst of a trek which ultimately leads to Patna Village where there is nothing apart from dense forest & a beautiful residential…
Patna Waterfalls,"GO HERE! Yes, it will take you a while to get here and it is a steep ascent, but it is so worth it. Best way to get there, just start on the east side of the Ganga river and start walking north on the road. No need to pay a car to take you. The walk down this road to the falls…"

Mansa Devi Temple,It's been very much commercial. There is no end to give donation in too many stops. They don't like the quantity of money you give. they ask at least 100 rupi for every spot. Too much pushing to sell offering materials. It was a bad experience.
Mansa Devi Temple,While the temple itself is okay - there are far better and more beautiful temples in Haridwar - the trip is great because of the Cable Car Ride. Gives you a birds eye view of the City. Located in the heart of Har Ki Pauri. So easy to get there as well.

But do not venture deep into the…"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"This place is still not polluted by the usual over crowd problem, coz it's require trekking in order to reach this place. One you reach you will feel the worth. Go early morning so you can enjoy alone. Zostel mukteshwar is 2.5 km from this place."

In the middle of jungle ( greenery) . Must visit. Wear comfortable shoes. And clothes. Follow arrows and direction.
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,Must visit place for adventure and fun. Beautiful enough to have lots n lots of photos. 1.2 km walk along the woods crossing small water streams thrice. Full of adventure and fun. Water is too cold to take bath.
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,The falls are too far from Mukteshwar or Nainital owning to really bad broken tarmac. The waterfalls offer a relief when you reach the spot but does not leave you awe inspired. These were very small waterfall and if you explore few more places or you a local there could be…
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"It's a 2.5 hour trek, full of nature scenery, 3 shallow stream crossings by step balancing on natural rocks. Wear comfortable walking gear, carry drinking water. The route is well marked. Awesome waterfall. Meditate with sound of water fall in the background!"

No organized official at the waterfront, they just give you life jackets. Changing rooms are for rs10 but are torn and not maintained at all. Lot of scope for improvement.…"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"The fall is located almost 1.5kms away from the main entry point. Once you buy the ticket, be prepared to walk up and down the trekking path. Nature walk at its best."
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"You trek for about 20-25 minutes one side which is a mix of different views amd treacherous at times. Its about 2.5kms trek in total. Once you reach the fall, dont expect it to be a big one. You can swim, take a dive in the fall too."
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"Nice place and should visit this, though the walk is very interesting and is steep one for 1km. Not suitable for elderly people or someone who have problem in walking"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,Visited Bhalu Gad waterfalls Mukteshwar along with my family.The trek to the fall and the Waterfalls was enchanting. It is important not to compare the beautiful nature and the Gentle fall with other great waterfalls. I have been to the awesome Niagaras falls but it shall be…
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"One need to walk 1-2 km to reach this waterfall..its a steep and slippery way...you can get eatery shops on the way... In season, there are lot of tourists and it's a crowded place..avoid it during that time.. Over all this place is ok ok..nothing to get amazed about . PS -…"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"As the title suggest, don't expect a high octane waterfall...on the contrary, it is barely 20 meters in height, and makes a very very gentle landing into the water pool below - which is very cold (naturally) However, it is the walk thru the jungle that is very blissful &…"

Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,Well every hill station has waterfall. So as Mukteshwar. A good spot to capture pictures. Soothing and clam.
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,This is clearly over rated. The path to the waterfalls is for very fit people who expect to see a great sight after having walked and trekked quite a bit. Guarantee they will be dissatisfied once they reach. The falls are quite small and have dirty surroundings. Avoid.
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"we travelled in April, water levels were relatively low. we have to croos two rivers through this 2 km trek. during the monsoon, it is quite impossible to cross these rivers. had to clamber down a steep rock to reach the waterfall. lovely trek and beutiful place"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"I was a bit skeptical in doing this after reading reviews. However if you are moderately fit and are ok in doing a big of trekking, you must visit it. However, if you are elderly or not at the best of your health, you might want to skip it as the way is a kachha rasta with…"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"a decent place but dhakuna waterfall was more heavy and good place , i would certainly suggest to go for dhakuna than bhalu gaad"
Bhalu Gaad Waterfalls,"Ideal for day treks, Bhalu Gaad is a hidden treasure in Mukteshwar, which shouldn't be missed. Best attraction in Mukteshwar. Around 1200 meter trek from the road to the fall which might be a challenge for old people"
